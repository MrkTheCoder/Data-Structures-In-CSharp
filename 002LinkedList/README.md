# LinkedList\<T\>
We will write a generic `LinkedList<T>` class step by step. But before that, If you do not know what is a linked list is, please read my explanation. (Otherwise, feel free to jump to the 1st step) 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
**What is a `LinkedList`?**

We are using `LinkedList` to store a list of items in sequence. Unlike Arrays, `LinkedList`s can grow or shrink automatically.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
**Structure of `LinkedList`?**

Linked Lists store each inserted item in a new object, and then it creates a link between these objects.  In this way, each object knows what object is next to it. We call these objects `Node`. Each `Node` at least own 2 pieces of data: 
- `Value` Property: our `item` will be store in this property. So `Value` type should be the same as our `item` type.
- `Next` Property: Its type is `Node` and Its job is to store address of the next `Node`.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
**How Linked Lists works?**

When we are inserting first `item` into the list, a new `Node` object will store the `item` in its `Value` property and since it is the only node in the list, its `Next` property stay null. Let's use a practical example and insert integer 10 in our `LinkedList` as a first item. Our item will be stored like this in first `Node` of `LinkedList`:

|Nodes:|node1|
|--|--|
|Value|10|
|Next|Null|

![notice-icon-7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/135717888-486318b4-7b6b-41ee-af24-bbeb181bb032.png) I put index for first node (node1), I shouldn't do that. I just did it, so for next examples you know which node will store in the `Next` row. In code - which soon we will write - we will only store next `Node` address inside the `Next` property of previous `Node`. (Which in above example, I mean `node1.Next`)

Now, when the next `item` inserted, Another new `Node` will be created and above process will be repeated except a new thing happen. The previous `Node` will store the new `Node` address inside its `Next` property. (`node1.Next = node2`) This is the way that each `Node` know about its next `Node`.  Let's continue our previous example. Now we will insert integer 20 in our `LinkedList` as second item:

|Nodes:|node1|node2|
|--|--|--|
|Value|10|20|
|Next|**node2**|null|

Now, `node1.Next` have address of `node2`. Then for the 3rd item, integer 30, `LinkedList` will be look like this:
|Nodes:|node1|node2|node3|
|--|--|--|--|
|Value|10|20|30|
|Next|**node2**|**node3**|null|

So we will have equations like these:

    node1.Next = node2;

    node2.Next = node3;

We can simplify above 2 equations to become:

    node1.Next.Next = node3;

Therefore, we can get any of nodes via `node1`, by moving forward and step by step through each `node.Next` until we reach to the last node. (`node3`)

We can simplify above tables and write something like this too:

10 -> 20 -> 30

There are 2 special nodes in each `LinkedList`:
- Head: We call the first node `Head`.
- Tail: the last node called `Tail`. 

So with these new names, the last table should be look like this:
|Nodes:|Head|node2|Tail|
|--|--|--|--|
|Value|10|20|30|
|Next|**node2**|**Tail**|null|


Also, We have 2 kinds of `LinkedList`:
-  **Singly**: each node only know about its next node address.
- **Doubly**: each node knows both next and previous nodes addresses.

We will create **Singly** type of `LinkedList` at the start and when you become familiar with it and know how it works then you can change it to support **Doubly** type too. 



&nbsp;

&nbsp;
**LinkedList Operations?**

We will add these operations into our `LinkedList<T>`
|Operation|Description|Time Complexity|
|--|--|:--:|
|AddLast|Add an item to the end of `LinkedList`.|?|
|AddFirst|Add an item to the first position of `LinkedList`.|?|
|IndexOf|Return index of an item in `LinkedList`, or -1 for not exists.|?|
|Contain|Return `true` if an item exists, otherwise `false`.|?|
|RemoveFirst|Remove first item of `LinkedList`.|?|
|RemoveLast|Remove last item of `LinkedList`.|?|
|ToArray|Convert `LinkedList` to an `Array`.|?|
|Reverse|Reverse all items in `LinkedList`.|?|
|GetKthNodeFromTheEnd|Return `K`'th item from the end of `LinkedList`.|?|

In each step, do not look at my code unless you solve it first. It is not important how long it takes to solve it. I put each step inside `#region` blocks, so you can easily collapse all then only expand the one you solved. I did this in both XyzDataStracture & XyzUnitTests projects.

For this exercise, please follow the below steps. 

## 1. Build `LinkedList<T>` & `Node<T>` classes
![Gear_Config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/136387498-f7f72a2b-7516-4c1a-a6bf-f9985d331300.png) Create new `LinkedList<T>` class file with these Conditions:
- Class members:
  - `public` class `Node<T>` inside it with these members:
    - A `public` property of type `T` to store value.
    - A `public` property of type `Node<T>` to store next node address.
    - A Constructor with 1 Parameter: of type T to set on Node value property.
  - `public` property `Head` of type `Node<T>` to store head of list address.
  - `public` property `Tail` of type `Node<T>` to store tail of list address.
  - A `public` property of type `int` to count list items.

![Stop_Wrong_Attention](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/137124180-e3654261-1fe6-487c-8dd8-de1970c41ae4.png) 
We shouldn't define `Head`/`Tail` and `Node` class as public members of `LinkedList`![Stop_Wrong_Attention](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/137124180-e3654261-1fe6-487c-8dd8-de1970c41ae4.png), because they are implementations details of `LinkedList` class, and they should not accessible from outside of this class. But just for unit test's purpose and examine them in more details, I did that. 

![notice-icon-7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/135717888-486318b4-7b6b-41ee-af24-bbeb181bb032.png) In real-world coding,  we should not change a `private` member to a `public`, so we can write some Unit tests against them. It is wrong! Instead, We should test them indirect via class behavior.

## 2. Add `AddLast` method:
`AddLast(T item)` method will add a new item to the end of  `LinkedList`.
 
![Gear_Config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/136387498-f7f72a2b-7516-4c1a-a6bf-f9985d331300.png) 
Define `AddLast` method with:
   - **1 Parameter**: of type T. It will be added to the end of `LinkedList`.
   - **Return**: `void` or, if you like to make it **Fluent Interface**, set return type as `LinkedList<T>`.

![Light](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/136387819-e8790a55-7543-421f-bc1d-dae492b2b0ec.png): Don't forget about `Count` property.

Then follow these steps:
   1. Make this method ready to add new item into the `LinkedList`.
   2. Write *UnitTest* to make sure it is working properly.
   3. What is the method Time Complexity?

I add some comments in unit test methods related to this method to explain how `LinkedList` works. Check `LinkedListUnitTests` class, region "[Tests for STEP 2]", after you wrote it yourself.

## 3. Add `AddFirst` method:
`AddFirst(T item)` method will add a new item to the beginning of  `LinkedList`. 

  ![Gear_Config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/136387498-f7f72a2b-7516-4c1a-a6bf-f9985d331300.png) Define `AddFirst` method with:
   - **1 Parameter**: of type T. It will be added to the beginning of `LinkedList`.
   - **Return**: `void` or if you like to make it **Fluent Interface**, set return type as `LinkedList<T>`.

Then follow these steps:
   1. Make this method ready to add new item into the `LinkedList`.
   2. Write *UnitTest* to make sure it is working properly.
   3. What is the method Time Complexity?

## 4. Add `IndexOf` method:
`IndexOf(T item)` method will compare each `Node.Value` property of `LinkedList` with inserted `item`, and if it found a match, then it will return the index of that node. Otherwise -1. As you know, `LinkedList` does not work with index like Array's do. So! Find a way! üòÅ

![Gear_Config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/136387498-f7f72a2b-7516-4c1a-a6bf-f9985d331300.png) Define `IndexOf` method with:
   - **1 Parameter**: of type T. It will be compared with each `Node.Value` in the `LinkedList`.
   - **Return**: `int` type. Index of node based on its distance from Head.(Zero Based) or -1, for not exist items.

Then follow these steps:
   1. Write this method.
   2. Write *UnitTest* to make sure it is working properly.
   3. What is the method Time Complexity?

**NOTE:** Please, check my comments at this method.

## 5. Add `Contain` method:
Add `Contain(T item)` method to check the `LinkedList` to see if inserted `item` exits or not. 

![Gear_Config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/136387498-f7f72a2b-7516-4c1a-a6bf-f9985d331300.png) Define `Contain` method with:
   - **1 Parameter**: of type T. It will be compared with each `Node.Value` in the `LinkedList`.
   - **Return**: `boolean` type.

Then follow these steps:
   1. Write this method.
   2. Write *UnitTest* to make sure it is working properly.
   3. What is the method Time Complexity?

![Light](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/136387819-e8790a55-7543-421f-bc1d-dae492b2b0ec.png) Respect DRY principle! üòâ (Don't Repeat Yourself)

## 6. Add `RemoveFirst` method:
Add `RemoveFirst()` method to remove first node from the `LinkedList`. 

![Gear_Config_v2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/136388347-9a594912-d0c5-47a7-8e78-d99e990bdf03.png)  Define `Contain` method with:
   - **No Parameter**.
   - **Return**: `void` or if you like to make it **Fluent Interface**, set return type as `LinkedList<T>`.

Then follow these steps:
   1. Write this method.
   2. Write *UnitTest* to make sure it is working properly.
   3. What is the method Time Complexity?

## 7. Add `RemoveLast` method:
Add `RemoveLast()` method to remove last node from the `LinkedList`.  This practice really take your time. 

![Gear_Config_v2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/136388347-9a594912-d0c5-47a7-8e78-d99e990bdf03.png)  Define `RemoveLast` method with:
   - **No Parameter**.
   - **Return**: `void` or if you like to make it **Fluent Interface**, set return type as `LinkedList<T>`.

Then follow these steps:
   1. Write this method.
   2. Write *UnitTest* to make sure it is working properly.

**Note**: Please check my comments.

  ![Light](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/136387819-e8790a55-7543-421f-bc1d-dae492b2b0ec.png) [*Do not read my tip If you wanna do it yourself without any help*] Just a small hint: We should loop from first to the last node and while we do this, remember the previous node so when we hit the `Tail`, we have its previous node.

## 8. Add `ToArray` method:
Add `ToArray()` method to return `T[]` array of the `LinkedList`. 

![Gear_Config_v2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/136388347-9a594912-d0c5-47a7-8e78-d99e990bdf03.png)  Define `ToArray` method with:
   - **No Parameter**.
   - **Return**: `T[]`  array type.

Then follow these steps:
   1. Write this method.
   2. Write *UnitTest* to make sure it is working properly.
   3. What is the method Time Complexity?

## 9. Add `Reverse` method:
Add `Reverse()` method to reverse the `LinkedList`.  This one can take more time than step 7 took.

![Gear_Config_v2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/136388347-9a594912-d0c5-47a7-8e78-d99e990bdf03.png)  Define `Reverse` method with:
   - **No Parameter**.
   - **Return**: `void` or if you like to make it **Fluent Interface**, set return type as `LinkedList<T>`.

Then follow these steps:
   1. Write this method.
   2. Write *UnitTest* to make sure it is working properly.
   3. What is the method Time Complexity?

![Light](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/136387819-e8790a55-7543-421f-bc1d-dae492b2b0ec.png) [*Do not read my tip If you wanna do it yourself without any help*] Let assume we have this `LinkedList` Items:

  10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40
  
What we like to do at start is changing 2nd `node.Next` direction from 3rd node to the first node. Right!? Like this:

  10 <- 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30 -> 40
  
But if we do that, we will lose the link to the 3rd node! Therefore, We have to first save that link in a variable (Let us call it `next`), then act on reversing the direction on 2nd `Node.Next`. After we're done with 2nd Node, we have 3rd Node address in that `next` variable.  
Try to do solve this problem yourself, even if it takes days to solve! I wrote full comments in this method about how my algorithm works.

## 10. Add `GetKthNodeFromTheEnd` method:
`GetKthNodeFromTheEnd(int k)` method get k of type integer and return Kth node from the end of the `LinkedList`.  This one also is a great exercise for your brain.

![Gear_Config_v2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/136388347-9a594912-d0c5-47a7-8e78-d99e990bdf03.png)  Define `Reverse` method with:
   - **No Parameter**.
   - **Return**: `void` or if you like to make it **Fluent Interface**, set return type as `LinkedList<T>`.

Then follow these steps:
   1. Write this method.
   2. Write *UnitTest* to make sure it is working properly.
   3. What is the method Time Complexity?

![Light](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25789969/136387819-e8790a55-7543-421f-bc1d-dae492b2b0ec.png) [*Do not read my tip If you wanna do it yourself without any help*] Let assume we have this `LinkedList` Items:

10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40

We want 3rd node from the end. (which it is 20) To solve this we can use 2 pointers, one get away 2 nodes from the first one (3rd - 1 = 2) :

10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40

\*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\*

Then we move both to the `Next` nodes:

10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\*

If the last node reach to the `Tail`, then the first node will be at the right position.

**LinkedList Operations and Time Complexity?**

`LinkedList` operations have these time complexies:
|Operation|Description|Time Complexity|
|--|--|:--:|
|AddLast|Add an item to the end of `LinkedList`.|O(1)|
|AddFirst|Add an item to the first position of `LinkedList`.|O(1)|
|IndexOf|Return index of an item in `LinkedList`, or -1 for not exists.|O(n)|
|Contain|Return `true` if an item exists, otherwise `false`.|O(n)|
|RemoveFirst|Remove first item of `LinkedList`.|O(1)|
|RemoveLast|Remove last item of `LinkedList`.|O(n)|
|ToArray|Convert `LinkedList` to an `Array`.|O(n)|
|Reverse|Reverse all items in `LinkedList`.|O(n)|
|GetKthNodeFromTheEnd|Return `K`'th item from the end of `LinkedList`.|O(n)|


## Extra practices:

We are done here! But you can continue to add extra features to it. Here are some ideas:

- Write `AddAfter(T item, T newItem)` method: `newItem` of type `T` will be added after `item`, if it found in the list.
- Write `AddBefore(T item, T newItem)` method: `newItem` of type `T` will be added after `item`, if it found in the list.
- Add `Before` property of type `Node` to the `Node` class members and store address of both `Next` and `Before` nodes of each item in the `LinkedList`.
  - Now, try to see which methods can use this new `Before` property to make their logic easier.
