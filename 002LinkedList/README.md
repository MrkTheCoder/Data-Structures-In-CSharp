# LinkedList<T>
We will write a generic LinkedList<T> class step by step.

In each step, do not look at my code unless you solve it first. It is not important how long it takes to solve it. I put each step inside `#region` blocks, so you can easily collapse all then only expand the one you solved. I did this in both XyzDataStracture & XyzUnitTests projects.

For this exercise, please follow the below steps. 

## 1. Build `LinkedList<T>` & `Node<T>` classes
Create new `LinkedList<T>` class file with these Conditions:
- Class members:
  - `public` class Node<T> inside it with these members:
    - A `public` property of type `T` to store value.
    - A `public` property of type `Node<T>` to store next node address.
  - A `public` property of type `Node<T>` to store head of list address.
  - A `public` property of type `Node<T>` to store tail of list address.
  - A `public` property of type `int` to count list items.
