# Queue\<T\>
We will write a generic `Queue<T>` class step by step. But before that, If you do not know what is a `Queue` is, please read my explanation. (Otherwise, feel free to jump to the 1st step)

**What is a `Queue`?**

Think of a supermarket customer queue. First customer to come, will stand in front of the line beside the counter, then next customer came in the line and will stand behind first person, then third person wil lstand behind the second person and .... But when the counter become available, the first customer in front of line will be the first one that go out. This action represents the **First In, First Out** concept or in short **FIFO**.

**Structure of `Queue`?**

`Queue` just like `Stack` internally use `Array` or `LinkedList` to store its objects. For this practice, We will use simple array in this practice to create our personal Stack class.
