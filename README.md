# Data Structures in CSharp (C#)
#### [Teach Others to Learn More Yourself!]

(*Still in progress ...*)

Hello!
This repository is for education purposes. There are various Data Structure library samples code in C# language in this repository. I'm hoping this will be useful for those studying Data Structure.

## Structure of Project:
I build all projects with .Net v5.0 (Core) as target framework, but you can use any other version of .Net if you like. I put each Data Structure topic in its own folder with 2 other projects. Each folder have these projects:
* A class library (DLL) with a name look like XyzDataStructure. Like: ArrayDataStructure, LinkedListDataStructure & ...
* A Console App. (Testing XyzDataStructure in action)
* Unit Tests. (To test all XyzDataStructure methods against different data.I used xUnit in these tests.)

I will fill each project with comments, so it will be more useful for study purpose.

I learned Data Structures from "[The Ultimate Design Patterns](https://codewithmosh.com/p/design-patterns/ "The Ultimate Design Patterns")" course by Mr. [Mosh Hamedani](https://codewithmosh.com/ "Mosh Hamedani")'s. He is the great and passionate teacher, who is making hard topics like piece of cake! Still! I'm learn new things everyday! and I hope you find this repository useful and learn something from it too.

Happy Codding!
