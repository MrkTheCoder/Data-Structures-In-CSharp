# Data Structures in CSharp (C#)
(Still in progress ...)

Hello! I just push this for education purposes. Any students of Data Structures are welcome to use it. I hope this will be helpful.

# Structure of Project:
I used .Net Core v5.0, but you can use any other version of .Net if you like. I put each Data Structure topic in its own Folder with 3 type of projects:
* Class Library (DLL) for each Data Structure.
* Console App. (For Compile and Running)
* Unit Test. (For Practicing on writing Unit Tests)
