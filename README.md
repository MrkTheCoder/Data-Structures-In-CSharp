# Data Structures in CSharp (C#)
[Teach Others to Learn More Yourself!]

(Still in progress ...)

Hello! I just push this for education purposes. Any students of Data Structures are welcome to use it. I hope this will be helpful.

# Structure of Project:
I used .Net v5.0 (Core) as target fraework, but you can use any other version of .Net if you like. I put each Data Structure topic in its own Folder with 3 type of projects:
* Class Library (DLL) for each Data Structure.
* Console App. (For Compile and Running)
* Unit Test. (For Practicing on writing Unit Tests)

I will fill each project with comments, so it will be more helpful to students.

I was a student of "The Ultimate Design Patterns" by Mr. Mosh Hamedani's. Furthermore, I still a student and never stop to learning new things. 

Happy Codding!
