# Data Structures in CSharp (C#)
#### [Teach Others to Learn More Yourself!]

(*Still in progress ...*)

Hello!
This repository is for education purposes. You can find all kind of Data Structure libraries here. I wish this will be useful specially for those that study these for first time.

## Structure of Project:
I used .Net v5.0 (Core) as target framework, but you can use any other version of .Net if you like. I put each Data Structure topic in its own folder with 2 other projects. Each folder have these projects:
* A class library (DLL) that start with DataStructureXyz name.
* A Console App. (Testing DataStructureXyz in action)
* Unit Tests. (To test all DataStructureXyz methods)

I will fill each project with comments, so it will be more helpful to students.

Once, I was a student of "[The Ultimate Design Patterns](https://codewithmosh.com/p/design-patterns/ "The Ultimate Design Patterns")" course by Mr. [Mosh Hamedani](https://codewithmosh.com/ "Mosh Hamedani")'s. Still! I am a student, Everyday I learn new things! I hope you find this repository useful.

Happy Codding!
